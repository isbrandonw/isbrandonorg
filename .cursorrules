  Follow the same conventions as CLAUDE.md:
  - Use ui-thing components before creating new ones
  - Follow Tailwind CSS conventions
  - Maintain TypeScript strict mode

  4. Task Handoff Strategy

  - Start with Claude Code: Initial setup, architecture decisions
  - Switch to Cursor: Fast iteration, small fixes, autocomplete
  - Return to Claude Code: Complex debugging, major refactors

  5. Version Control Discipline

  - Commit Claude Code changes separately from Cursor changes
  - Use descriptive commit messages indicating which tool was used
  - Review all AI-generated code before committing

  6. Tool Selection Guidelines

  Use Claude Code for:
  - Multi-file refactoring
  - Complex debugging
  - Architecture decisions
  - Documentation generation

  Use Cursor for:
  - Single-file edits
  - Autocomplete assistance
  - Quick bug fixes
  - Rapid prototyping

  This approach maximizes both tools' strengths while maintaining code quality and consistency.
